Question: What happens when you initialize a repository? What do you need to do it?
- When you initialize a repository, the following happens:
-- .git is added to the directory (where history is recorded)
-- you can use this directory as a git repository
-- a branch (master branch) is created
-- no commit is yet created
-- a list of untracked files is given, but these are not yet part of the repository
- In order to be able to initialize a repository, you need:
-- a directory
-- git is installed
-- execute git init command

Question: What is the difference between Staging Area and Repository and Staging Area 
and Working Directory
- The Repository contains the commits, that is all the files (and their state) which are 
contained in the Staging Area
- The Staging Area on the other hand does only contain the files that the user selects 
in order to have them in the staging area so that these can be commited to the Repository
- This shows: The Staging Area contains a subset of the files of the Working Directory
- The Repository contains 'snapshots' of the state of the Staging Area, that is, 
of subsets of the Working Directory at a certain point in time
- What value does the Staging Area offer? 
1) It allows for keeping the commits as small as possible
