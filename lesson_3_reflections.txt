Question: When would you want to create a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?
- when working with others
- when sharing my work
- when storing my work online while working on it from 
different locations and computers
- when I want to have a second storage as a backup

Questions: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- you don't know who is (possibly) working on your GitHub repository
- so you have no control on what changes are introduced
- so you don't know what changes will be introduced locally by pull
- also, git doesn't know which branch and which commit to pull
